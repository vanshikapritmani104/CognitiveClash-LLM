Cognitive Clash
Overview
The Cognitive Clash project is focused on developing an AI system that enables large language models (LLMs) to engage in structured debates on engineering and domain-specific topics. By simulating debates, the system enhances understanding, fosters problem-solving, and promotes critical reasoning.

The primary goal is to leverage diverse viewpoints to tackle complex engineering challenges while addressing biases and ethical considerations inherent in these discussions. Through this process, Cognitive Clash aims to improve decision-making, uncover new insights, and encourage deeper exploration of key issues. Ultimately, this project seeks to drive more robust, well-rounded solutions to complex problems in engineering and beyond.

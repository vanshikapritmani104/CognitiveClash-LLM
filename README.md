# Cognitive Clash

## Project Overview
**Cognitive Clash** is an AI system designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to participate in structured debates on engineering topics. The goal is to enhance understanding, foster problem-solving, and promote critical reasoning by leveraging diverse viewpoints. This system is specifically focused on addressing biases and ethical considerations within engineering and other domain-specific contexts.

## Key Features
- **Structured Debates**: Facilitates organized, multi-turn debates on complex engineering topics.  
- **Diverse Viewpoints**: Promotes engagement from various perspectives to drive more comprehensive problem-solving.  
- **Bias & Ethics**: Designed to identify and address biases, ensuring ethical considerations are integrated into decision-making.  
- **Critical Reasoning**: Encourages deeper analysis and critical thinking through thoughtful dialogue.  
- **Insight Generation**: Facilitates uncovering new insights by fostering detailed discussions on intricate problems.  

## Project Goals
- **Enhance Understanding**: Deepen knowledge of engineering topics through dynamic, AI-driven debates.  
- **Promote Problem-Solving**: Leverage diverse viewpoints to explore and resolve engineering challenges.  
- **Address Biases & Ethics**: Focus on mitigating biases and integrating ethical reasoning in domain-specific decisions.  
- **Improve Decision-Making**: Enable more informed, well-rounded decision-making processes.  
- **Encourage Exploration**: Drive deeper exploration of complex issues to arrive at robust solutions.
